<center><h1><font face="chiller">ABOUT YUJI ITADORI</font></h1></center>
<p><font face="georgia">Yuji Itadori (虎いた杖どり悠ゆう仁じ Itadori Yūji?) is the main protagonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is the son of Jin Itadori and Kaori Itadori. Yuji is the grandson of Wasuke Itadori who was living a normal life until he encountered Megumi and ate one of Sukuna's fingers. After becoming Sukuna's vessel, Yuji began attending Tokyo Jujutsu High alongside Megumi and Nobara as first-year students.</p><br>

<center><h1><font face="chiller">CHARACTERISTICS</h1></center></font>
<p><font face="georgia">Yuji is one of his school's most powerful and talented students, Satoru Gojo placing him on the same level of potential as Yuta Okkotsu and Kinji Hakari as one of the three students who he believes will surpass his strength. Despite having no connections to the jujutsu world before a few months prior to the Shibuya Incident, Yuji is able to contend with and defeat Grade 1 and Special Grade curses. Yuji was gifted with superhuman physical abilities which he masterfully combines with his cursed energy. Yuji is also able to contain Sukuna with no ill effects. This enables him to harm Mahito, whose control over the shape of his soul otherwise renders him resistant to injury.</p>
